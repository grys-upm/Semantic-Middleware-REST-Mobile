REST Mobile describes one of the microservices that make up a specific semantic middleware framework, developed by the a specific semantic middleware framework, developed by the GRyS (Next Generation Networks and Services Group) group. GRyS (Next Generation Networking and Services Group). The component provides a REST interface based on the HTTP protocol, which enables the interconnection of two main two main elements, a repository or database management system, an alarm or observation management system with REST and MQTT interface. At the same time the component provides a series of methods with which it offers a simple connection to a graphical connection to a graphical interface, such as a smartphone application, or any other type of device or any other type of device or computer application.

The main objectives of the REST Mobile program are the injection and updating of alarms or observations associated with a given asset and the distribution of data over a repository in a near real-time environment.

Both the data provided as input for the different operations and the responses offered by the component conform to specific JSON schemes, against which they will be validated, in case they correspond to the input of the operation, or serialized for the construction of the responses. In this way, data can be extracted and read in a consistent way, as well as easily interpreted by a program wishing to attack this particular service.

The REST Mobile component exposes a user interface under the default domain https://torcos.etsist.upm.es:9212/docs/, however, the URL on which the component is exposed can be changed through the properties file. In this user interface, the necessary documentation for the attack to the different queries or POST and PUT operations offered by the component is provided. Similarly, the interface allows testing of the methods offered, for testing purposes and for the adaptation or coding of services or programs that wish to attack the REST Mobile. In addition, the different JSON schemes used are presented.
